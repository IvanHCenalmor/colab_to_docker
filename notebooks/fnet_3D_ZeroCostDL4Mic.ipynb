It was first published in 2018 by [Ounkomol *et al.* in Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0111-2). The network uses a common U-Net architecture and is trained using paired imaging volumes from the same field of view, imaged in a label-free (e.g. brightfield) and labelled condition (e.g. fluorescence images of a specific label of interest). When trained, this allows the user to identify certain structures from brightfield images alone. The performance of fnet may depend significantly on the structure at hand.\n","\n","---\n","<font size = 4> *Disclaimer*:\n","\n","<font size = 4> This notebook is part of the Zero-Cost Deep-Learning to Enhance Microscopy project (https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepLearning_Collab/wiki).

After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data.
