This is based on the original [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) implementation published by the same authors. YOLOv2 is trained on images with class annotations in the form of bounding boxes drawn around the objects of interest. The images are downsampled by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and objects are classified in two final fully connected layers in the network. YOLOv2 learns classification and object detection simultaneously by taking the whole input image into account, predicting many possible bounding box solutions, and then using regression to find the best bounding boxes and classifications for each object.\n","\n","<font size = 4>**This particular notebook enables object detection and classification on 2D images given ground truth bounding boxes.

Inspection of the loss function**\n","---\n","\n","<font size = 4>First, it is good practice to evaluate the training progress by comparing the training loss with the validation loss. The latter is a metric which shows how well the network performs on a subset of unseen data which is set aside from the training dataset.

Comparing the development of the validation loss with the training loss can give insights into the model's performance.\n","\n","<font size = 4>Decreasing **Training loss** and **Validation loss** indicates that training is still necessary and increasing the `number_of_epochs` is recommended. Note that the curves can look flat towards the right side, just because of the y-axis scaling. The network has reached convergence once the curves flatten out. After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data.
